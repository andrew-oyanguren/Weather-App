### General Info
I really enjoyed this project. Using APIs is the coolest thing! I used a weather API, got a key for it, and just figured out path to the data I needed by console logging the api data. I then inserted the data I wanted to use into my DOM elements. I am obsessed with the idea of creating apps using APIs.
